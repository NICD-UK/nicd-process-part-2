# Introduction

## Data Science Processes

A **data science process** includes:

1. data science workflow (e.g. CRISP-DM)
2. collaboration framework (e.g. Scrum)

The data science workflow provides the **what** and the collaboration framework provides the **how**. A popular example of a data science process is:

- **Microsoft**: Team Data Science Process (TDSP)

## Data Science Workflow

The *focus* of this presentation is on data science workflows. The three most popular data science workflows are:

1. CRISP-DM
2. TDSP
3. SEMMA

## Data Science Workflow

A critical literature review of data science processes: [Data Science Methodologies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07287.pdf)

I selected the CRISP-DM data science workflow because:

- [most popular data science workflow](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-still-most-popular/) (49% usage)
- hierarchical structure with phases, tasks and processes
- comprehensive 76 page [CRISP-DM guide](https://www.the-modeling-agency.com/crisp-dm.pdf)
- communicable CRISP-DM figure and table (see guide)

# CRISP-DM

## CRISP-DM

CRISP-DM consists of 6 **phases** and 24 **tasks**. The tasks are described in a 76 page [CRISP-DM guide](https://www.the-modeling-agency.com/crisp-dm.pdf). The six phases of CRISP-DM are:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modelling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

These phases are represented as *vertices* in a directed graph where the *edges* represent transitions between phases.

## CRISP-DM

I am going to modify the CRISP-DM data science workflow at the task level. I will propose modifications of the **tasks** and **outcomes**:

- **delete, insert and update tasks**
- rename tasks
- **delete, insert and update outcomes**
- rename outcomes

I have renamed four of the 26 tasks. These changes where for naming consistency.

## CRISP-DM

Modifications to the Data Preparation and Modelling phases are related to organising transformations (part 1):

- order and partition of transformations across **data pipeline**
    - partition into clean, wrangle, model/report
- partition of transformations across **data sources/products**
    - partition for each data source when cleaning
    - partition for each data product when wrangling

# Business Understanding

## Business Understanding

1. **Determine Business Objectives**: *background*; *business objectives*; *business success criteria*
2. **Assess Situation**: *inventory of resources*; *requirements, assumptions and constraints*; *risks and contingencies*; *terminology*; *costs and benefits*
3. **Determine Data Science Questions**: *data science questions*^a^; *data science success criteria*
4. **Plan Project**: *project plan*; *initial assessment of tools and techniques*

**Modifications**:

- **updated outcome**: ^a^*data mining goals*

## Business Understanding

I have changed *data mining goals* into *data science questions* for two reasons:

1. *data science* is the more modern term for *data mining*
2. can incorporate the *data questions* introduced in [What is the question?](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/Stats_What_Question_2015.pdf?g_zGQR5m3rDJqwXqJ3DxLI5pXZ3hNdHk)

    - **questions**: descriptive, exploratory, inferential, predictive, causal and mechanistic

# Data Understanding

## Data Understanding

1. **Collect Raw Data**: *raw data*; *initial cleaning scripts*^1^; *initial clean data*
2. **Describe Data**: *description report*
3. **Explore Data**: *exploration report*

**Modifications**: 

- **insert outcomes**: *raw data*; *initial clean data*
- **updated outcome**: *initial data collection report*^1^
- **delete task**: **Verify Data Quality**

## Data Understanding

The **Collect Raw Data** task involves importing raw data from data sources and writing that data. This results in:

- initial cleaning script (*not cleaning*)
- initial clean data (*not clean*)

The reports can be generated from this initial clean data. This facilitates iteration of the **Clean Data** task.

## Data Undrestanding

The **Verify Data Quality** task is deleted since it is redundant. The quality of the data can be assessed with the **Describe Data** and **Explore Data** task.

## Data Understanding

The description report will support the data preparation phase (e.g. **Clean Data** task):

- number of rows and columns
- column names and types
- column statistics (e.g. univariate and bivariate)

The exploration report will support the business understanding phase (e.g. business objectives and data science questions). The data description report can be output with:

1. [pandas profiling](https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/master/rtd/) package in `Python`
2. [dlookr](https://choonghyunryu.github.io/dlookr/index.html) package in `R`

# Data Preparation

## Data Preparation

1. **Clean Data**: *cleaning scripts*; *clean data*
2. **Wrangle Data**: *wrangling scripts*; *wrangle data*

**Modification**:

- **outputs added**: *clean data*; *wrangle data*; *wrangling scripts*
- **tasks combined**: **Integrate Data**, **Construct Data** and **Select Data**
- **task removed**: **Format Data**

## Data Preparation

The tasks:

- **Integrate Data** (e.g. join data)
- **Construct Data** (e.g. feature engineering)
- **Select Data** (e.g. filtering examples and selecting features)

were combined into the **Wrangle Data** task. These tasks where in the wrong order and the outcomes where too abstract. The **Clean Data** and **Wrangle Data** tasks each output scripts and data.

## Data Preparation

The **Format Data** task was deleted because it was data preprocessing. Every modelling techniques requires a different data preprocessing. Including this task before the **Select Modelling Techniques** tasks is problematic. This task is now implicit in the **Build Model** task. 

# Modelling

## Modelling

1. **Select Modelling Techniques**: *modelling techniques*; *modelling assumptions*
2. **Select Test Design**: *test design*
3. **Build Model**: *modelling scripts*; *models*; *model descriptions*
4. **Assess Model**: *model assessment*

**Modifications**:

- **output added**: *modelling scripts*

## Modelling

The *modelling scripts* outcome was a natural addition to the **Build Model** task. 

# Evaluation

## Evaluation

1. **Evaluate Results**: *evaluation of data science results with respect to business success criteria*; *approved models*
2. **Review Process**: *process review*
3. **Determine Next Steps**: *possible actions*; *decision*

## Deployment

1. **Plan Deployment**: *deployment plan*
2. **Plan Monitoring and Maintenance**: *monitoring and maintenance plan*
3. **Produce Final Report**: *final report*; *final presentation*
4. **Review Project**: *project review*

# Project Template

## Project Template

The outputs can be mapped to file and directories in a [project template](https://github.com/NICD-UK/project-template/blob/main/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.repo_name%7D%7D/README.md). The `README.md` of the project template includes:

- project organisation (directory structure)
- the phases, tasks and outcomes of CRISP-DM
- the tasks have section numbers from the [CRISP-DM Guide](https://www.the-modeling-agency.com/crisp-dm.pdf)
- outputs have a location in the directory structure
